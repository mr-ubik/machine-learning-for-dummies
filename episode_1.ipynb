    "Python offers an easy path to the mastery of almost any aspect of the programming world, from simple scripts to embedded systems to complex web architectures and artificial intelligence, this language has everything covered. Python is the ultimate swiss army knife of programming languages. It is often the first tier choice for almost any task and when it is not you can easily bet on it being the number 2 or 3 choice. This makes learning (and teaching) it to newcomers a no-brainer (and that is why you see many universities starting to shift from Java to Python (or Javascript, the only other language I would award of my versatility badge)), once the basis are covered you can quickly ramp up to more complex tasks. The language has been growing steadily for the past 20 years, it has no intention to stop and while adoption accelerates, the community surrounding it becomes larger and more vibrant, propelling development of the core language and its libraries in a virtuos circle, so virtuos that just from 2016 to 2017 Python jumped from 4th place to 1st in StackOverflow Developer Survey Most Wanted Language category. There's also an ever increasing demand for Python Developers and becoming a Pythonista may be one of the most profitable decision you can make right now.

    "The new kid on the block, Julia is to me more like a modern take on the R concept, capable of attracting an increasing community, it offers speed, readability and ease of analysis all in one package. It is for sure interesting although being in its infancy makes support for multiple workflows and libraries scarce at times.\n",

    "A nice syntax, a built-in dataframe, a plethora of great packages and a great IDE in the form of R-Studio made R the long-time king of Data Science and Statistical analysis. Python stole the fire of the Dataframe from the Gods and with Jupyter also established a better platform/technology for the interactive analysis/exploration. A way larger community coupled with the rise of Jupyter, Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow made Python slightly more popular than R for these tasks. Mostly used by statisticians, biologists and widely taught at both undergraduate and graduate level, R is still a force to be reckoned with, especially when it comes to quick exploratory analysis. My advice is to learn Python first and R secondly, you do not necessarily need one if you have the other but together they voltron into a new whole degree of awesome.\n",

    "Functional programming on the JVM has never been cooler than now since living in the age of Big Data means sooner or later having to deal with distributed parallel computing and that means considering Spark. Python having picked up proper support for functional programming with Coconut and having built PySpark can make Scala a little redundant. However if you plan on specializing in the use of Spark and its ecosystem or on being mind blown by the trip inducing functional style Scala is the language for you. Coursera currently has the best MOOC on functional programming and Scala, once you are ready to have your mind challenged and your horizon expanded go and look up a functional programming language."
